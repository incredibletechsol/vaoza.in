					Our role as a trading intermediary can take one of two forms: principal or agent. When acting as the principal in the business we confirm the contract, take the credit risk and invoice the buyer - we make a profit by including a small margin for ourselves between the sales price and the purchasing costs. When acting as agent, the supplier invoices the buyer directly and we make a profit by way of a commission or fee from the producer. Whether we act as principal or agent, the marketing service offered to the producer is the same.
